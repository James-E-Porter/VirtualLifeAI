# VirtualLifeAI

**VirtualLifeAI** is an ambitious project combining cutting-edge AI, IoT, and simulation technologies to create a virtual life experiment. This repository documents the development and integration of an AI assistant powered by the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. The AI interacts with its environment through cameras and sensors, lives as an animated avatar in a voxel-based world rendered in Unreal Engine, and is brought to life through a Pepper’s Ghost illusion in a custom dollhouse.

## Project Goals

1. **AI Assistant (LLM/AGI)**:
   - A robust AI assistant acts as the "brain" of the system.
   - Processes inputs from an array of cameras and sensors.
   - Responds intelligently to user interactions and environment dynamics.

2. **Input Systems**:
   - Integrates cameras and sensors to perceive the external world.
   - Uses advanced AI pipelines for image, audio, and sensor data processing.

3. **Virtual Avatar**:
   - A realistic avatar rendered in a voxel/Minecraft-style world in Unreal Engine 5.3.
   - Supports real-time animation and interactions.

4. **Pepper’s Ghost Illusion**:
   - Displays the avatar in a dollhouse using the Pepper's Ghost effect.
   - Simulates a physical manifestation of the AI within a tangible world.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Hardware**:
  - NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit
  - Cameras, microphones, and other IoT sensors
  - Custom-built Pepper’s Ghost dollhouse

- **Software**:
  - [JetPack SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack): Development environment for NVIDIA Jetson.
  - TensorRT, PyTorch, and TensorFlow for AI model deployment.
  - Unreal Engine 5.3 for the virtual world and avatar rendering.
  - OpenCV and NVIDIA DeepStream SDK for image and video processing.
