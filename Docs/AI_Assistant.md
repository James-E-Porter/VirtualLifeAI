# **AI Assistant Design Document**

## **Overview**

The AI Assistant will serve as the central intelligence driving the VirtualLifeAI project. It will be capable of understanding, responding to, and interacting with external inputs like cameras, microphones, and sensors, as well as manifesting behaviors and interactions through a realistic virtual avatar.

## **Objectives**

1. **Core Capabilities**:
   - Process and interpret sensor input (visual, auditory, and others).
   - Engage in natural language conversations using a robust language model.
   - Adapt behavior based on environmental changes and user interaction.

2. **Integration with Hardware**:
   - Utilize the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for edge computing.
   - Connect to external hardware like cameras, microphones, and additional sensors.

3. **Output Behavior**:
   - Drive the virtual avatar’s animation and dialogue in real-time.
   - Act as the "brain" for both virtual and physical experiments.

## **Features**

1. **Language Model**:
   - Use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) like **LLaMA 2**, **Falcon**, or **GPT-J** optimized for edge inference.
   - Convert models to NVIDIA TensorRT for real-time performance on Jetson hardware.

2. **Sensor Integration**:
   - **Cameras**: Use OpenCV or NVIDIA DeepStream SDK for visual input processing (e.g., object detection, face tracking).
   - **Microphone**: Employ an audio pipeline for voice interaction using frameworks like SpeechBrain or DeepSpeech.

3. **Real-time Decision Making**:
   - Implement reinforcement learning or simple rule-based logic for quick decisions.
   - Use contextual memory for short-term interactions.

## **Architecture**

1. **Input Pipeline**:
   - **Cameras**: Visual data processed via CSI interfaces or USB-connected cameras.
   - **Microphones**: Audio data processed for speech recognition and natural language input.
   - **Other Sensors**: Data acquisition from GPIO/I2C/expansion headers.

2. **Processing Pipeline**:
   - Preprocess data (image/audio cleaning and normalization).
   - Run inference using an optimized language model or image-processing model.
   - Decide responses or actions based on input.

3. **Output Pipeline**:
   - Generate natural language responses.
   - Control avatar animations and interactions in Unreal Engine.
   - Trigger hardware actions like moving a servo or LED for physical feedback.
