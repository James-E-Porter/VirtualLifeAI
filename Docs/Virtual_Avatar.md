# **Virtual Avatar Design Document**

## **Overview**

The Virtual Avatar represents the AI Assistant within the virtual world, acting as its visual and interactive manifestation. This avatar will reside in a voxel-based virtual environment rendered in Unreal Engine and will be animated to reflect real-time AI responses and behaviors.

---

## **Objectives**

1. **Realistic Representation**:
   - Create a highly realistic and interactive avatar for the AI Assistant.
   - Enable lifelike animations and expressions to reflect the AI’s state and responses.

2. **Virtual Environment**:
   - Design a voxel-based, Minecraft-style world as the avatar’s habitat.
   - Allow the avatar to interact with objects and elements in this world.

3. **Real-Time Interaction**:
   - Synchronize the avatar's behavior and animations with the AI Assistant’s output.
   - Support seamless communication between the AI and the virtual world.

---

## **Features**

1. **Avatar Design**:
   - Use tools like MetaHuman or Blender for realistic avatar creation.
   - Integrate detailed textures, facial expressions, and dynamic animations.

2. **Voxel-Based World**:
   - Render the virtual world in Unreal Engine 5.3 with voxel/Minecraft-like aesthetics.
   - Include interactive elements for the avatar to manipulate or explore.

3. **Real-Time Animation**:
   - Animate the avatar dynamically based on AI inputs (e.g., gestures, facial expressions, movements).
   - Synchronize avatar dialogue with speech synthesis.

4. **Integration with Pepper’s Ghost**:
   - Display the avatar in the physical world using the Pepper’s Ghost illusion within a dollhouse setup.

## **Architecture**

1. **Avatar Creation**:
   - Use Unreal Engine and MetaHuman for detailed avatar models.
   - Export custom avatars from Blender if MetaHuman is insufficient for voxel-world compatibility.

2. **Virtual World Design**:
   - Develop a voxel-based environment in Unreal Engine using procedural generation.
   - Include interactive objects and environmental effects.

3. **Animation and Control**:
   - Link AI Assistant outputs (e.g., speech, gestures) to Unreal Engine’s animation controller.
   - Use Unreal Engine’s animation blueprints to manage real-time avatar behavior.

4. **Real-Time Interaction**:
   - Establish communication between the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and Unreal Engine.
   - Use protocols like WebSocket, MQTT, or custom APIs for real-time input/output.

## **Resources**

### **Hardware**
- **Display Setup**:
  - Use an HDMI or DisplayPort connection to render the virtual world and avatar on an external display.
- **Pepper’s Ghost System**:
  - Construct a dollhouse with reflective glass or plastic for projecting the avatar.

---

### **Software**
- **Avatar Creation**:
  - [MetaHuman](https://www.unrealengine.com/metahuman): For creating lifelike avatars.
  - Blender: For customizing and designing additional 3D models.

- **Virtual World**:
  - Unreal Engine 5.3: For building and rendering the voxel-based environment.
  - Plugins for voxel-based world generation (e.g., Voxel Plugin Pro).

- **Animation**:
  - Unreal Engine’s animation blueprints and control rig for real-time animations.
  - NVIDIA Omniverse (optional) for advanced animation workflows.

- **Communication**:
  - Use Python libraries or Unreal Engine C++ APIs to connect the AI Assistant with the avatar.

## **Implementation Steps**

1. **Avatar Design**:
   - Create a realistic avatar using MetaHuman or Blender.
   - Implement animations, including facial expressions and body movements.

2. **Virtual World Development**:
   - Design and render a voxel-based world in Unreal Engine.
   - Add interactive objects and environmental effects.

3. **Synchronization**:
   - Connect the AI Assistant’s output to the Unreal Engine world.
   - Map AI-generated gestures and speech to avatar animations and dialogue.

4. **Pepper’s Ghost Integration**:
   - Set up the dollhouse with a Pepper’s Ghost projection system.
   - Synchronize the Unreal Engine output with the Pepper’s Ghost display.

---

## **Next Steps**

- Finalize avatar design and initial animations.
- Build the virtual environment with basic interactions.
- Test synchronization between AI outputs and avatar behaviors.
- Integrate the Pepper’s Ghost display system.
